    <h2>Yummy Cookie</h2>

    <p>Much like cake, cookies are made from a soft, thick dough and are denser than an English biscuit. 
        When they are finished, cookies are larger, softer, and chunkier than their biscuit cousins.</p>

    <p>To most of the rest of the English-speaking world, a biscuit is what Americans would refer to as either a cookie or a cracker.
       Biscuits can be sweet (shortbread) or savory.</p>
